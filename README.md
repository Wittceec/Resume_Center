Interactive 3D Data Center Resume

Welcome to my interactive 3D resume! This project is a unique and engaging way to explore my professional background, skills, and projects, all within a virtual data center environment. Instead of a traditional document, you can navigate a network topology map to learn more about my qualifications.
Features

    Immersive 3D Environment: The resume is set in a fully rendered 3D data center, complete with server racks, glowing lights, and a network grid floor.

    Interactive Network Topology: The core of the resume is a network map where each device (Cloud, Router, Switch, Server, Workstation) represents a different section of my professional profile.

    Click-to-Explore Navigation: Simply hover over a device to see it light up, then click to zoom in and view the detailed information for that section.

    Dynamic Content Panels: Information is presented in clean, modern pop-up panels that appear when you select a device.

    Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on any device.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: The structure of the web page.

    Tailwind CSS: For modern and responsive styling of the UI components.

    JavaScript (ES6+): For all the core logic, interactivity, and scene management.

    Three.js: A powerful 3D graphics library used to create and render the entire data center scene.

    GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For all the smooth camera animations, hover effects, and transitions.

How to Use

    Overview: The page loads with a top-down view of the entire network topology.

    Explore: Move your mouse over any of the labeled devices (e.g., // PROJECTS). The device will glow and scale up to indicate it's interactive.

    Zoom In: Click on any highlighted device to zoom the camera in for a closer look. An information panel with details about that section will appear.

    Return to Map: To zoom back out to the main overview, you can either click the red [x] button in the top-right corner of the info panel or click on any empty space in the data center background.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this unique look into my professional world!
